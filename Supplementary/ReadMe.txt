
Hello!


Please Find the following files:

1. Comparison of Fusion Schemes on Thumos14

- This file contains the comparison in performance of the different audio-visual fusion techniques and 
the audio only and video only approaches used in the paper, on the Thumos14 Dataset. The mAP scores are 
reported for the best performing audio-visual model on Thumos14, which is the MUSES baseline, with
I3D feature extractor for visual modality and VGGish feature extractor for Audio modality.


2. Comparison of Fusion Schemes on ActivityNet-v1.3

- This file contains the comparison in performance of the different audio-visual fusion techniques and 
the audio only and video only approaches used in the paper, on the ActivityNet-v1.3 Dataset. The mAP scores are 
reported for the best performing audio-visual model on ActivityNet-v1.3, which is the GTAD model, with
TSP feature extractor for visual modality and VGGish feature extractor for Audio modality

3. False_Negative_Error_Analysis_ActivityNetv1.3

- This image contains a plot showing the change in False Negative Error Rates(%) in terms of coverage and length of 
instances for the best multimodal setup on ActivityNet-v1.3 (which is the GTAD model, with TSP feature extractor 
for visual modality) with the inclusion of audio (VGGish features).

4. False_Negative_Error_Analysis_Thumos14

- This image contains a plot showing the change in False Negative Error Rates(%) in terms of coverage and length of 
instances for the best multimodal setup on Thumos14 (which is the MUSES baseline, with
I3D feature extractor for visual modality) with the inclusion of audio (VGGish features).
